Shows the last YouTube video from a given channel.


== Description ==

Shows the last YouTube video from a given channel. Custom fields allow you to easily change the height and width of the embedded video to suit your theme, making it easy to use in any of your sidebars or widgetized footers.

This plugin is based on the hugely helpful article found at go41 WebDesign (http://forum.go41.de/topic/add-a-youtube-user-channel-video-to-wordpress). We needed to make the installation and configuration a little more user-friendly, so we wrapped it up into a widget, complete with user-configurable settings from within the widget panel.

It is very lightweight and simple to implement.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Drag the widget to the desired location in the 'Widgets' menu in WordPress (under 'Appearance')
4. Enter the desired settings.
